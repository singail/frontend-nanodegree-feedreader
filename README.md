# Frontend nanodegree Feed Reader Testing
===============================

## About the project

This project is a part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program of Udacity. As a student I was provided a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. My goal was to write test suites using testing framework for JavaScript.

## What is Feed Reader and how to use it 

Feed Reader allows a user to keep track of many different websites and their content in a single website. User is able to click menu icon and select a topic with different news feed. Pressing the link of a single news entry opens a different website with useful content.
